### Fork Move
 A Fork move is a move that creates multiple winning opportunities.

 For example, two-in-a-row and two-in-a-column at the same time. When a fork is formed, two winning positions appear. The opponent can not block both winning positions with one move, thus leads to a win.


 A `Blocking Fork Move` is a move to block the opponent from forming a fork.
