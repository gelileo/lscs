            <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
            
            We're gonna continue on our `Tic Tac Toe` game developed from last semester.
            This is a two-player game where each player takes turns to mark a square on a 3x3 grid.
            The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

            <p>
                This time, we're gonna make some adjustments so that human players can play against the computer.

            Click to view or download the starter code for this project.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./src/run.html">run.py</a></li>
                <li><a href="./src/particle.html">particle.py</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Code Refactor</h2>
            <p>Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior or
                functionality.
                It improves the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of the code, making it easier to understand,
                debug,
                and extend in the future. </p>
                <h3>Common Refactoring Techniques</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extract Method: Pulling out a piece of code from a long function into its own method to reduce complexity and improve
                    readability.</li>
                    <li>Rename Variables: Giving variables meaningful names to improve clarity.</li>
                    <li>Remove Duplicate Code: Eliminating redundant code by creating reusable functions or classes.</li>
                    <li>Separation of Concerns: Use python modules to separate different functionalities into distinct files, making the codebase
                    more organized and manageable.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            We're going separate the starter code <code>run.py</code> into multiple files:
            <ul>
                <li><code>game_logic.py</code>: Contains the game logic functions like <code>check_win</code> and <code>check_tie</code>.</li>
                <li><code>colors.py</code>: Contains the color constants used in the game.</li>
                <li><code>drawings.py</code>: Contains the drawing functions like <code>redraw</code> and <code>button_rect</code>.</li>
                <li><code>main.py</code>The remaining code after moving functionsout. It contains the main running loop of the code</li>
            </ul>

            Here's what your <code>main.py</code> should look like after refactoring:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./src/refactored_fib/main.html">main.py</a></li>
               
            </ul>
            Please finish the rest of files
