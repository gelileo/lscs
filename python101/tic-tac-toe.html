        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

        We're gonna continue on our `Tic Tac Toe` game developed from last semester.
        This is a two-player game where each player takes turns to mark a square on a 3x3 grid.
        The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

            This time, we're gonna make some adjustments so that human players can play against the computer.
