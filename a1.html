    <h1>Building Design General Description</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Name</strong>: New Fosai Mexico Project – Workshop #1</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Unit</strong>: Wuhu Fosai Technology Co., Ltd.</li>
            <li><strong>Location</strong>: Aguascalientes, Mexico</li>
            <li><strong>Building Area</strong>: 29,854.32 square meters</li>
            <li><strong>Building Structure</strong>: Portal frame structure, large scale, designed for a service life of
                25 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Floors</strong>: Single-story; height from ground to building eave is 15.00 meters.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fire Hazard Classification</strong>: Category D, not considered a densely populated workshop.
                The fire resistance rating of the plant design is level 2.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Design Elevations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Elevation indicators are in meters, and general floor plan dimensions are in meters, while construction
                drawing dimensions are in millimeters.</li>
            <li>The design zero point (+0.000) is equivalent to an absolute elevation level.</li>
            <li>Elevation marks for each floor, the roof, and openings are structural elevations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Wall Construction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Below +0.000</strong>: Use solid concrete bricks.</li>
            <li><strong>Exterior Walls</strong>: Below 1.200m – 200mm thick hollow brick protective wall; above 1.200m –
                Profiled steel plate wall.</li>
            <li><strong>Office Area Partition Walls</strong>: 200mm thick hollow bricks with a fire resistance of not
                less than 2.50 hours. Office and meeting room partitions use lightweight calcium silicate cement boards.
            </li>
            <li>Reinforce hollow brick walls in areas requiring load-bearing or perforation, to be confirmed during
                construction.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Roofing Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drainage Organization</strong>: Refer to the roof plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Lighting Belt</strong>: Use translucent materials capable of self-melting at high temperatures
                without producing molten drops. The distribution is shown in the roof plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Roof Type</strong>: Corrugated steel roof, detailed in construction methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Rainwater Gutters</strong>: Steel structure eaves with internal gutters using 1.5mm thick 304
                stainless steel. Rainwater pipes are 133x95 metal rectangular downspouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Concrete Roof</strong>: Uses an internal rainwater drainage system with DN100 galvanized
                rainwater pipes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Door and Window Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All door and window elevations indicate the opening size. Verify dimensions on-site before processing.
            </li>
            <li>Except where specified, all exterior windows use dark gray matte aluminum alloy.</li>
            <li>Frosted glass for bathroom, shower room, and window glass.</li>
            <li>Gaps between window frames and openings should be filled with polyurethane foam and sealed with sealant.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Decoration Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Selection of decoration materials regarding material, specifications, and color will be provided by the
                construction unit for approval by the building unit before finalizing samples.</li>
            <li>Follow the decoration practices shown in the engineering method table.</li>
            <li>Decoration works should comply with fire safety requirements and not affect structural safety or damage
                facilities like water, electricity, and ventilation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Waterproofing Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bathroom floors and ground have a 1.5mm thick synthetic polymer waterproof coating. The coating should
                rise along the walls and be at least 200mm high.</li>
            <li>Bathrooms should have moisture-proof layers with polymer cement waterproof mortar.</li>
            <li>Pipes passing through floor slabs should have waterproof casings extending at least 20mm above the
                finished floor.</li>
            <li>Ensure waterproofing between the floor and wall at the bathroom corners with additional fabric of 300mm
                width.</li>

            <li>Avoid painting during adverse weather conditions.</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Anti-Corrosion and Other Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sub-components like purlins and tie rods should follow anti-rust methods according to local standards
                and comply with relevant specifications.</li>
            <li>All exposed metal parts, except for special mentions, require rust removal to meet SSPC-SP10/NACE No.2
                standards, followed by two layers of red lead alkyd anti-rust primer and two layers of gray topcoat.
            </li>
            <li>Exposed steel surfaces will use a color confirmed by the construction party.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Construction Notes</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <ul>
                <li>Combine closely with the professional construction drawings and equipment installation projects

                <li>Prohibit using harmful additives and coatings during construction.</li>
                <li>In case of any errors or discrepancies found in the drawings, report to the designer promptly for
                    resolution.</li>
                <li>Construction should strictly comply with national standards and ensure cooperation with other
                    specialties like process, structure, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, automation, etc.</li>
                <li>Maintain strict adherence to quality inspection norms during construction.</li>
